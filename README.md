Features
The world is divided into regions which define the difficulty of the enemies you’ll face, as well as changing environmental features such as forestry or mountainous regions. 
Your objective is to clear each region by defeating all of the enemies in each area. By clearing a region, you will be awarded with skill points. At any point you can open the 
menu to view the map, including details for each region of the world and your progress through each. Here you can also travel to the skill tree menu where you will be able to 
purchase upgrades with the skill points you have collected.
